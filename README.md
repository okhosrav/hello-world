# hello-world

My name is Ojan Khosravifar, I am a MSc Candidate at the University of Western Ontario in London, ON, Canada. My project is focused on understanding the pathophysiology of mouse models of colitis which are important components of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research. More specifically, my project aims to conduct single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on various mouse models of colitis in order to shed light on which of these models are most faithful to IBD in humans, thereby guiding their use in future IBD research.

The biggest challenge of my project is developing the bioinformatic skills necessary for analyzing the data generated by scRNA-seq. I recently joined Github because every bioinformatician I have met has one, so it seemed like a good idea.
